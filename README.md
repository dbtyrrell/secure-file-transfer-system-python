# secure-file-transfer-system-python

A Python language program using end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for secure file transfer over untrusted networks with a zero trust architecture (ZTA).

## Features

### Implemented

- Confidentiality: Encryption with Transport Layer Security (TLS)

### Pending implementation

- Integrity: 
    - Digitial signing and verification of files
    - SHA-256 checksums
- Availability: Asymmetric key generation

- Authentication: User registration and password hash management
- Authorisation: Role-based access control (RBAC) with r|w|x enforcement
- Accounting: Tamper evident audit logs
